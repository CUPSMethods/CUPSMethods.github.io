*Presenter: John Marshall*

### Plan

I'm going to be presenting results and intended analyses from a working paper, which uses shocks to second-degree connections to estimate the effect of information passed from peer to peer. I intend to go through the method and some of the data issues involved (including construction of networks), as well as present the results and some of the ways we are thinking about (and difficulties of) robustness checks.
