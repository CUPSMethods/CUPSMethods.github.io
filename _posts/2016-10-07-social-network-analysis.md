### Plan

Now that we have got our workflow established and our Python distribution installed, this week we will take a look at [NetworkX](https://networkx.github.io/), a Python library designed for easy creation, analysis, and visualization of network structures. Along the way we'll learn more broadly useful Python "tricks" and data manipulation techniques, so hopefully you can get a lot out of it even if you never end up doing network analysis!

### Setup Instructions

1. Follow the setup instructions from [last week](https://cupsmethods.github.io/from-r-to-python/), if you haven't already
2. Use the `pip` (or `pip3` if you use `python3`) utility to install networkx (`pip install networkx` or `pip3 install networkx`, respectively) and matplotlib (`pip install matplotlib` or `pip3 install matplotlib`) from your terminal.

### Link to Workshop Materials

All of the materials for this week are within [this Dropbox folder](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/el6md0ebkpe3kzz/AABHjCTBTcf-j9kNFxHSO721a?dl=0). We will be going through _NetworkX\_Tutorial.pdf_ and examining/running/editing the code examples (`basic_network.py` and `country_network.py`) throughout.
