*Presenter: Tara Slough*

### Plan

Quantitative (statistical) methods and formal theory represent two "toolkits" central to graduate training in political science. However, we rarely discuss the merits and limitations of combining the two approaches, whether within a single work, a substantive research agenda, or something in between. This workshop will be a discussion framed with several works that discuss the integration of quantitative and formal work, with a focus on empirical methods of causal inference. We will conclude with a brief presentation of two working papers that utilize innovative approaches to integrating formal and empirical work.
