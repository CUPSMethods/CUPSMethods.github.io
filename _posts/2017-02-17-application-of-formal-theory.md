### Plan

I am going to present my work in progress on multi-member districts in a way that will help people developing their own formal models.

The abstract for the paper:

*In many political jurisdictions, electoral districts are represented by multiple legislators that are elected according to party lists. By empowering party elites to shape their members' electoral fortunes, lists contaminate the ability of voters to hold their representatives to account. Why, then, should voters benefit from party lists? When voters are uncertain of their representatives' commitment to promoting party goals ahead of their constituents, individual incentives may undermine the pursuit of collective goals. We unearth circumstances in which voters value shared control of representatives' electoral incentives with party leaders, and describe under what conditions multi-member PR lists can balance these trade-offs.*
