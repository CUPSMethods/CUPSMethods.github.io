### Plan

Empirical research--qualitative or quantitative--relies on our ability to accurately measure concepts of interest. This session will review a few "classic" works on measurement in social science. We will then discuss best practices for applied research in two ways. First, we will examine some recent research that problematizes common practices and/or makes efforts to improve measurement in research that employs commonly- used datasets. Second, we will discuss best practices for improving measurement/construct validity in research employing original data collection.

**Prospective students are welcome to participate!**
