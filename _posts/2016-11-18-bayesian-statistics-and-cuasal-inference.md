### Plan

Professor Gelman will be holding a Question and Answer session on

- Non-Bayesian methods
- Causal Inference
- The role of survey methods in this past election.

This workshop should be a great opportunity to have an in-depth discussion on these issues. Here are two links which have topics Professor Gelman has presented or commented on to help us all get started with questions: [Prof. Gelman's Personal Website](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/presentations/) and [Prof. Gelman's Blog](http://andrewgelman.com/).

**If you plan on attending, please come with two prepared questions that you would like to discuss!**
